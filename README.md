# AzureBootcamp2017
Files used in the Azure Bootcamp presentation (Los Angeles, CA).

This presentation focused on building an Angular (4) app with an Azure DocumentDB database, accessed via a .Net Core 1.1 WebApi.  Since it's a SPA application, the Angular website is hosted in a different space than the WebApi, so there's a good example of how to implement CORS to make this work.

## GolfTracker
This is a fairly complex Angular app that allows users to manage golf clubs and golfers, and enter and track the scores for golfers.  It's a full CRUD application and demonstrates how to perform fine grain CRUD operations even to deeply nested DocumentDB JSON documents.

## Docker
If you want some examples that use Docker, one of our developers, Jeff Etter, is at the San Francisco Azure Bootcamp.
